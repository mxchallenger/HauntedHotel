# Project Description

This project was completed in my software development bootcamp through Catalyte. Originally, it was a React front-end only project with a deployed API on Heroku. The API was given to everyone to build their front end from. Since then, I have added a new backend using Supabase and brought the front end and back end together.

The project is a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using:

- **ReactJS**
- **Supabase**
- **Material-UI**

## Features

### Room Types Management
- **Create:** Add new hotel room types at the Haunted Hotel.
- **Read:** View all room types.
- **Update:** Edit existing room types.
- **Delete:** Remove room types.
- **Dynamic Image Display:** Images are dynamically displayed from URLs for each room type.

### Reservations Management
- **Create:** Book a reservation for a room type.
- **Read:** View all reservations.
- **Update:** Modify existing reservations.
- **Delete:** Cancel reservations.
- **Reservation Cost Calculation:** The application uses the room type ID to fetch the room rate and calculate the total cost based on the number of nights.

### Additional Features
- **Form Validation:** Ensures data integrity and provides a smooth user experience.
